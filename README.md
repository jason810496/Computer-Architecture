# Computer Architecture using RISC-V
This repository contains descriptions and solution of labs for learning computer architecture using the [`RISC-V`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) instruction set architecture.

## Course Overview
This course covers the fundamentals of computer architecture ( assembly code ), with a focus on the [`RISC-V`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain)  instruction set architecture.
